## TODO

- improve config mechanism (e.g. https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config
  or just https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env for now or
  something like an `exec.js`: http://stackoverflow.com/a/32993213)
- the debug module is quite useful (as could be redux-logger from the renderer)
- log application version on start (using https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkginfo?)
