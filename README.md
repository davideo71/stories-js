## Usage

To set up the development environment, first install node.js. Then run `npm install` to install the required node packages.

Then to start the application, run `npm start`. Later on we can use [Electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) to create self-contained apps.


## Development

To keep code consistent, it is helpful to make use of the EditorConfig and ESLint (corresponding VSCode packages: 'EditorConfig for VS Code', 'ESLint').
